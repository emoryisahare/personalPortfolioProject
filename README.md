# personalPortfolioProject
This is my portfolio of freeCodeCamp projects so far (which are also uploaded in my other repositories).  
This project was created using HTML/CSS  

The images folder contains logos of the following companies:  
GitHub  
CodePen.io  
freeCodeCamp  
Linked In  
  
I do not own any of these images and am only using them for educational purposes.  
    
      
This project can also be found here (without images): https://codepen.io/emoryisahare/pen/qzeyzg  
All tests are passing.
